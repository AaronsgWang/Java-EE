# JPA with Queries in XML files

This repository contains a sample application to my blog plost on how to have Spring Data JPA Queries located in XML files.

You can read the article here: https://hahamo.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/jpa-queries-in-xml-files

## Requirements

* Java EE 7
* Java SDK 8
* a Java EE 7 compatible application server

I tested the application with WildFly 10.0 and JDK 1.8.0_71 on Mac OSX 10.11

## Usage

Just build and deploy the application to a Java EE 7 container. After it starts go to http://localhost:8080/jpa_xml to see it working. 
If your server has an alternative port and not *8080* use that port in the URL above.
